APPROXILYZER
=========================================================

Approxilyzer is an open-source framework for instruction level approximation 
and resiliency software. Approxilyzer provides a systematic way to identify 
instructions that exhibit first-order approximation potential. It can also identify 
silent data corruption (SDC) causing instructions in the presence of single-bit errors. 
Approxilyzer employs static and dynamic analysis, in addition to heuristics, to reduce 
the run-time of finding Approximate instructions and SDC-causing instructions by 3-6x 
orders of magnitude.
